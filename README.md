# GymAPI

The GymAPI is a simple REST API created using Kotlin and Spring Boot that manages a gym system. 
It's possible to register students (customers) and instructors. The API controls customers fees and allows 
instructors to create training sessions for their students.

# Requirements
- Kotlin 1.8.22
- Java 17
- PostgreSQL
- Good IDE like [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# Usage

Assuming you have Maven in your path, just run in project root folder:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
